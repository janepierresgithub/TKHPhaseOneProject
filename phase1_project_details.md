# Phase One Project

The purpose of this project was to create the foundations of a cybersecurity lab applying the concepts of Linux Terminal Operations, Networking Fundamentals, and other Cybersecurity concepts and tools that we learned in class during Phase One of The Cybersecurity and Networking Program of the Innovation Fellowship at The Knowledge House. This project consisted of three parts:

**Topology: Networking Diagram.** A topology in Cisco Packet Tracer, displaying the layout and design of the cybersecurity lab setup. Included are workstations, a server, firewall, IDS, IPS, SIEM, attack and target machines.

**Cybersecurity Lab in the Virtual Environment.** Contains the various components, services and tools that were downloaded, installed, and configured to create the cybersecurity lab. This includes Snort (IPS), Suricata (IDS), Security Onion (SIEM), pfSense (firewall), Kali Linux (attack machine), Metaspoiltable 2 (target machine) and Ubuntu (the LinuxOS for the workstations, server, IPS, IDS and SIEM.

**Phase One Project Paper.** This paper dicusses and describes the various cybersecurity components (services and tools) that make up this security lab. This paper seeks to answer the following questions: What are these tools and services that were utilize in the lab? Why are they important in the cybersecurity industry?
