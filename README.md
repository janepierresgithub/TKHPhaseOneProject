# Phase One Project

Stemming from the learnings of Linux Terminal Operations, Networking Fundamentals, and other integral cybersecurity concepts, this project was embarked upon to craft a rudimentary yet robust cybersecurity lab.  The project comprised three elements: the creation of a cybersecurity lab within a virtual machine environment, the design of the lab's network topology, and a paper explaining the components and tools downloaded, installed, and configured for the cybersecurity lab's development.

**Topology: Networking Diagram.** A meticulously crafted network topology displaying the layout and design of the cybersecurity lab setup, delineating the structure, interactions, and flow within the simulated environment.  Included are workstations, a server, firewall, IDS, IPS, SIEM, attack and target machines.

**Cybersecurity Lab in the Virtual Environment.** Contains the various components, services and tools that were downloaded, installed, and configured to create the cybersecurity lab. This includes Snort (IPS), Suricata (IDS), Security Onion (SIEM), pfSense (firewall), Kali Linux (attack machine), Metaspoiltable 2 (target machine) and Ubuntu (the LinuxOS for the workstations, server, IPS, IDS and SIEM.

**Phase One Project Paper.** This paper dicusses and describes the various cybersecurity components (services and tools) that make up this security lab. This paper seeks to answer the following questions: What are these tools and services that were utilize in the lab? Why are they important in the cybersecurity industry?
