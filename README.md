# Phase One Project

This project aimed to establish a basic cybersecurity lab, utilizing skills learned from Linux Terminal Operations, Networking Fundamentals, and other cybersecurity concepts. These skills were part of Phase One of The Cybersecurity and Networking Program in the Innovation Fellowship at The Knowledge House. The project comprised three elements: the creation of a cybersecurity lab within a virtual machine environment, the design of the lab's network topology, and a paper explaining the components and tools downloaded, installed, and configured for the cybersecurity lab's development.
