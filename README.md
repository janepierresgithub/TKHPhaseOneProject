# Phase One Project

Stemming from the learnings of Linux Terminal Operations, Networking Fundamentals, and other integral cybersecurity concepts, this project was embarked upon to craft a rudimentary yet robust cybersecurity lab.  The project comprised three elements: the creation of a cybersecurity lab within a virtual machine environment, the design of the lab's network topology, and a paper explaining the components and tools downloaded, installed, and configured for the cybersecurity lab's development.

**Topology: Networking Diagram.** A meticulously crafted network topology displaying the layout and design of the cybersecurity lab setup, delineating the structure, interactions, and flow within the simulated environment.  Included are workstations, a server, firewall, IDS, IPS, SIEM, attack and target machines.

**Cybersecurity Lab in the Virtual Environment.** Leveraging the power of virtualization, a cybersecurity lab was set up containing the various components, services and tools that were downloaded, installed, and configured. This includes Snort (IPS), Suricata (IDS), Security Onion (SIEM), pfSense (firewall), Kali Linux (attack machine), Metaspoiltable 2 (target machine) and Ubuntu (the LinuxOS for the workstations, server, IPS, IDS and SIEM.
